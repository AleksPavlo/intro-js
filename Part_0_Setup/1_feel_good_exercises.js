////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Welcome to the 1st exercise sheet of Programming Fundamentals in JavaScript!
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// All the text that follows a double "slash", that is //, is a comment.
// Whatever follows the double slash on the same line is ignored by
// the computer, it is just for you to read.

// Empty lines are also ignore, obviously.

// Comments are perhaps the most important
// What do programmers write in these comments?
// Imagine yourself opening this file in 2 years. What would you
// like to know in the most concise way possible?

// In this file, comments contain the instructions for the exercises
//  as well as useful hints.

// Enough said. Let's begin with the basics of JavaScript!
// We will start with the "primitive types.""
// A primitive type (or simply a type) is a category af variables
// in a language that share a set of common features.

// I hope you don't get bored. If so, just continue with the exercises
// in the next file at your own pace. You will find the solutions in the
// folder called solutions. Who would expect that?

// EXERCISE 1 Indentation.
//////////////////////////

// a. Select all the code below and press TAB. Ta da!
// Did something happened? If not, please check again the slides
// to setup Atom.

let a=              1234       ;
   a++;
                if (  a > 123 ) {
a--;
        }
                                              else a++
        console.log(a);

// b. What are the differences with the code indented on the slide?
// Automatic indentation simply adjustes the space on the left-hand
// side of your code. It neither adds missing parentheses nor trims
// white space between words. That is up to you to do it.
// Do it, does it read better? Can you grasp what it is doing?



// EXERCISE 2 Linting.
